Developer dashboard that helps us to make sure everything important works as expected.

Displayed data:

- Critical installations
- Failed DB refactorings
- Failed merges
- Failed deployments (internal test systems)
- Test Coverage and SonarQube issues for Nice2 project

## URL

The dashboard is reachable at these addresses:

- https://dashboard.tocco.ch
- http://xmsjjm6rmqsstcjs.onion
- http://fpmntuq7o2vcaw24sfsjyfhk7koofbrtjika7awddqyysbo5buil5gad.onion

## Deployment

Commits pushed to master are automatically deployed. However, as of now, the page needs to be reloaded
manually browser-side to see the updates.

## Credentials for Adapters

### `credentials.json`

Credentials for adapters are read from `credentials.json` in the **current working directory**.

The file has the following syntax:

```json
{
  "teamcity": {
    "password": "JAi2rKIi4KNaqQc",
    "username": "dashboard"
  },
  "backoffice": {
    "password": "YTWWlD9u6MnE3Tw",
    "username": "dashboard"
  }
}
```

In this example, the adaptor **teamcity** uses the username **dashboard** and the password **JAi2rKIi4KNaqQc**.

### Obtaining Current Passwords from OpenShift

1.  Change to the dashboard project: `oc project toco-dashboard`

2.  Find a running pod:

    ```
    $ oc get pods -l app=dashboard
    NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    dashboard-12-mqdj9   1/1       Running   0          20h
    ```

3.  extract `credentials.json` from one of the running pods:

    ```
    $ oc exec dashboard-12-mqdj9 -- cat credentials.json
    {
     "teamcity": {
      "password": "JAi2rKIi4KNaqQc",
      "username": "dashboard"
     },
     "backoffice": {
      "password": "YTWWlD9u6MnE3Tw",
      "username": "dashboard"
     }
    }
    ```

### Changing or Adding a Password for an Adapter on OpenShift

1.  Change to the dashboard project: `oc project toco-dashboard`

2.  Set username **peter** and password **1234** for adapter **backoffice**:

    ```
    oc set env dc/dashboard DBOARD_CREDS_backoffice=peter:1234
    ```

    This sets the **DBOARD_CREDS_backoffice** env. variable which is used to generate
    a `credentials.json` automatically.

### Removing a password for an Adapter on OpenShift

1.  Change to the dashboard project: `oc project toco-dashboard`

2.  Remove credentials for adapter **teamcity**:

    ```
    oc set env dc/dashboard DBOARD_CREDS_teamcitye=-
    ```
